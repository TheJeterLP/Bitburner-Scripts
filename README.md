# Bitburner-Scripts
Collection of my own little Bitburner Scripts

Usage: use the infect.js file to start the BotNet.

the infect.js file will copy and execute the hacking.js File to all Servers found.
If no root access is available it tries to get root access using gainRoot.js

Infect.js does NOT replace the script when its running on the target Server.

If you change the hacking.js file on the home Server and want to publish it to every Server, use the stopHack.js file to kill all Processes in the BotNet.
Then simply use the infect.js again. 

I use the purchaseServer.js script to automatically gain Servers. Just use it every once in a while when you dont have your limit reached yet.

I also use the nodes.js to buy and upgrade Hacking Nodes. For now only upgrading the level of them is supported. 
Just edit the Settings inside the script.
